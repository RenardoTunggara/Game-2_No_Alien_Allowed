Game inspired by duck hunt
The game will continue to run and there is no condition that makes the player lose

The game tells the story of where there is an alien invasion that comes to attack the earth.
which initially the main character did not really care about it because he felt he lived in a forestry area so it was safe with the alien invasion that only attacked cities and crowds.
But it turned out that there was one alien plane that strayed into his place and captured his wife and children 
and just left so he thought that his wife and child had been killed by the aliens so he wanted revenge. 
so he wanted to take revenge, but because all the alien planes he saw were the same 
the same shape so he destroyed all the spaceships in his area.
